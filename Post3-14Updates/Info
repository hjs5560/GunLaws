Anushka: Post the notes that you took from the meeting in this file.
Do test, train, and unseen data

Do out-of-sample error analysis on pre-intervention

For slope train the model on the training set and then predict it on the test set and then run it on the unseen dataset. 

For every state you have a table(for a given error metric), each state is a row and then columns are error metrics on 1 time step ahead 2 time step ahead, and 3 time step ahead. In each cell report the mean, SD of the error metric, and the number of out-of-sample predictions that we could evaluate. 

You might want to order it. Make it readable. What about being a Z square to care about? We have multiple different types of intervention so there may be different tables.

SD with respect to different types of crimes. 

3 columns for the mean and 3 columns for the linear model
